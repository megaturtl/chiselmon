Bugs:
- Pc bookmark button renders after the glow which looks weird
- make egg show in front of portrait
- forms aren't being synched to the dummyegg pokemon
- sometimes the catch rate shows 0.0% which shouldn't be true (this was catching event rapidash with a love ball)

High priority:
- make the quicksort key bindable
- fix morecobblemontweaks not being able to multiselect egg dummies
- when sorting by name/dex number, use egg hatched % as the comparator before level
- render berry of an ev berry cake on the item
- fix boss predicate (boss in displayname e.g. boss banette) displayName: Â§4Â§lBoss Banette titledName: Â§4Â§lBoss Banette
- mode that highlights mons that you have rendered for more than 30 secs (for kill platting)
- fully grown cobblemon crop markers
- add an exclamation mark/waypoint option to spawnalert
- add shiny star in name of shinies (done)
- add ot as an option in jade (done)
- ball catch chance in offhand (done)
- spawnlogger counts plushies in special spawns?

Nice to have:
- auto pause logger when exit minecart
- glow correspond to priority bucket?
- show loaded pokemon count in the surrounding chunks, and eligible for despawn count?
- make all text translatable (lang file)
- total pc fullness % (and number of eggs)

- Eventually move each seperate config and command class to its own feature directory, everything should be owned by the features!!

One day:
- improve the multiselect feature from morecobblemontweaks
- Add a set all before/after key in wallpapers
- If a mon meets the high iv cap and also has a 0 iv show a custom rusted bottle cap
- Add a jade tooltip if a block is pokemon spawnable
- add a contents/list/scrollthrough for pc pages (name of box, how many pokemon in each, hover on box to see what's inside - kinda like an inv view)

- BELOW ARE IN MORECOBBLETWEAKS
- Command/ ui button etc to switch 2 boxes
- Move all button that moves all mons to current box (and moves the first 6 to your party if possible)

Current known limitations:
- Quick and timer balls don't know the current turn (quick assumes turn 1)
- Egg preview uses default form
