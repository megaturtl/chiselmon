Bugs:

High priority:
- make the quicksort key bindable
- fully grown cobblemon crop markers

Nice to have:
- auto pause spawnlogger when exit minecart
- show loaded pokemon count in the surrounding chunks, and eligible for despawn count using a hud library widget. currently loaded, eligible for despawn, average lifetime, etc. then also number of cakes, cake bites remaining, cakes who only need 1 more randomtick.
- make all text translatable (lang file)
- total pc fullness % (and number of eggs)

One day:
- improve the multiselect feature from morecobblemontweaks
- Add a set all before/after key in wallpapers
- If a mon meets the high iv cap and also has a 0 iv show a custom rusted bottle cap
- add a contents/list/scrollthrough for pc pages (name of box, how many pokemon in each, hover on box to see what's inside - kinda like an inv view)
- keep track of the tickslived when entity unloads so i can add it to the number if we see that entity again (need to prevent mem leaks tho)

Current known limitations:
- Quick and timer balls don't know the current turn (both assume turn 1)
- Egg preview uses default form
- SpawnAlert has trouble distinguishing wild pokemon from  and some pokedisguises
