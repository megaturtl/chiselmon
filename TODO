Bugs:
- Pc bookmark button renders after the glow which looks weird
- Fix moving eggs visual glitch (maybe fixed, changed where my mixin swaps the egg for the dummy pokemon)
- make egg show in front of portrait
- forms aren't being synched to the dummyegg pokemon
- sometimes the catch rate shows 0.0% which shouldn't be true (this was catching event rapidash with a love ball)

High priority:
- add a way to save the logger session in a txt file or smth (csv better)
- customsorter should sort eggs after regular pokemon (as a species tiebreaker) and have another tiebreaker (level probably)
- update name to Chiseledmon!
- add new alert sounds (bow ping etc) (done)

Nice to have:
- make all text translatable (lang file)
- total pc fullness %
- Find a way to get the egg packet sooner (currently only updates when put in and out of pc)
    KEEP IN MIND: the /egginfo command egg hatches at 512 steps left (2 cycles) maybe that can help me get more accurate
- Customise pc expanded tooltip in the config (choose the fields you want)

- Eventually move each seperate config and command class to its own feature directory, everything should be owned by the features!!

One day:
- improve the multiselect feature from morecobblemontweaks
- Add a set all before/after key in wallpapers
- If a mon meets the high iv cap and also has a 0 iv show a custom rusted bottle cap
- Show actual marks on hover with their chance
- Add a jade tooltip if a block is pokemon spawnable

- BELOW ARE IN MORECOBBLETWEAKS
- Command/ ui button etc to switch 2 boxes
- Move all button that moves all mons to current box (and moves the first 6 to your party if possible)
