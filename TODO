Bugs:

High priority:
- add screenshots to the config descriptions (like chesttracker)

ALERTS
- add a nicer way to select tags for the ui

Nice to have:
- fully grown cobblemon crop markers
- quick evolve or smth
- auto pause spawnlogger when exit minecart
- make all text translatable (lang file)
- total pc fullness % (and number of eggs)

One day:
- client side catchcombo tracking to derive my own data (ansun suggests shiny %)
- maybe also prevent throwing balls at the wrong mon when on a catchcombo ("CC Lock" or smth)
- pc living dex checklist
- interactive heatmap generator with the db data. maybe you type a command and it hosts a local web server where you can move stuff around or smth.
- improve the multiselect feature from morecobblemontweaks
- Add a set all before/after key in wallpapers
- Add a jade tooltip if a block is pokemon spawnable
- add a contents/list/scrollthrough for pc pages (name of box, how many pokemon in each, hover on box to see what's inside - kinda like an inv view)

Current known limitations:
- Quick and timer balls don't know the current turn (both assume turn 1) FIXED!! I THINK!! nvm it's still broken on servers
- Egg preview uses default form
