HUD Element that tells current spawn rate of a mon and the bracket it's in (from a command)
Hover pokemon with ball to get catch odds
Egg hatch percentage in health bar (FIX MIXIN)

Middle click in pc to sort box by default sort setting (define in config)

Find a way to get the egg packet sooner (currently only updates when put in and out of pc)


KEEP IN MIND: the /egginfo command egg hatches at 512 steps left (2 cycles) maybe that can help me get more accurate
