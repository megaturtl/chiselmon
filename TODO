Bugs:

High priority:
- add screenshots to the config descriptions (like chesttracker)

ALERTS
- add a nicer way to select tags for the ui
- maybe add pitch slider to alert sounds config

Nice to have:
- fully grown cobblemon crop markers
- quick evolve or smth
- auto pause spawnlogger when exit minecart
- make all text translatable (lang file)
- total pc fullness % (and number of eggs)

One day:
- improve the multiselect feature from morecobblemontweaks
- Add a set all before/after key in wallpapers
- If a mon meets the high iv cap and also has a 0 iv show a custom rusted bottle cap
- Add a jade tooltip if a block is pokemon spawnable
- add a contents/list/scrollthrough for pc pages (name of box, how many pokemon in each, hover on box to see what's inside - kinda like an inv view)

Current known limitations:
- Quick and timer balls don't know the current turn (both assume turn 1) FIXED!! I THINK!!
- Egg preview uses default form
- SpawnAlert has trouble distinguishing wild pokemon from  and some pokedisguises
