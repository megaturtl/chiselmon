Bugs:
- Pc bookmark button renders after the glow which looks weird
- make egg show in front of portrait
- forms aren't being synched to the dummyegg pokemon
- sometimes the catch rate shows 0.0% which shouldn't be true (this was catching event rapidash with a love ball)

High priority:
- make the quicksort key bindable
- fix morecobblemontweaks not being able to multiselect egg dummies

Nice to have:
- auto pause logger when exit minecart
- glow correspond to priority bucket?
- show loaded pokemon count in the surrounding chunks, and eligible for despawn count?
- make all text translatable (lang file)
- total pc fullness % (and number of eggs)

- Eventually move each seperate config and command class to its own feature directory, everything should be owned by the features!!

One day:
- improve the multiselect feature from morecobblemontweaks
- Add a set all before/after key in wallpapers
- If a mon meets the high iv cap and also has a 0 iv show a custom rusted bottle cap
- Add a jade tooltip if a block is pokemon spawnable

- BELOW ARE IN MORECOBBLETWEAKS
- Command/ ui button etc to switch 2 boxes
- Move all button that moves all mons to current box (and moves the first 6 to your party if possible)
