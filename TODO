High priority:
- HUD Element that tells current spawn rate of a mon and the bracket it's in (from a command?)
- Command/ ui button etc to switch 2 boxes
- Move all button that moves all mons to current box (and moves the first 6 to your party if possible)
- PC page bookmarks at top of screen (like tabs)
- Add each jade tooltip as a toggleable option in the jade plugin settings

- Fix quick ball and timer ball logic


Nice to have:
- Find a way to get the egg packet sooner (currently only updates when put in and out of pc)
    KEEP IN MIND: the /egginfo command egg hatches at 512 steps left (2 cycles) maybe that can help me get more accurate
- Customise pc expanded tooltip in the config (choose the fields you want)


One day:
- Add a set all before/after key in wallpapers
- If a mon meets the high iv cap and also has a 0 iv show a custom rusted bottle cap
- Show actual marks on hover with their chance
- Add a jade tooltip if a block is pokemon spawnable
